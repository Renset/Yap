# Yap
Meet Yap - Yet Another Pomodoro timer made in SwiftUI. Originally made while experimenting with the ChatGPT and then fine-tuning the UI/debugged code.

The goal of this project is to learn the Swift & SwiftUI ecosystem and have a nice pomodoro timer. The timer still needs a lot of work, but it's functional.
